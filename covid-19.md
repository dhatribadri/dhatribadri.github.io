## Epitope sites on COVID-19

**Project description:** At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Our goal was to find a site that a neutralizing antibody can bind to that is crucial for viral entry of the cell and prevent it from entering the host cell. Hence, our primary target was the S protein as it plays a key role in viral attachment, fusion, entry, and transmission. Host cell entry depends on the binding of the viral S proteins to cellular receptors and S protein priming by host cell proteases (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Particularly, our focus was on the S1 subunit which consisted of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is crucial for binding to host cells (Jiang et al., 2020). We want to find an epitope site on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence where a neutralizing antibody can bind to and this site would ideally be important for viral cell entry and contain a possible proteolytic cleavage site. Furthermore, a strongly neutralizing antibody is one that competes for both cell entry and protease cleavage. 

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
