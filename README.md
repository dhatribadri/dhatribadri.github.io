## Dhatri Badri's Portfolio Landing Page 

### Introduction

If you are seeing this, hi and welcome to my GitHub page! This is my personal space where I rave about all things related to Biology and Bioinformatics. You can skip to the good part and go directly to my website [here](dhatribadri.github.io). If you are stll here that's great! My name is Dhatri and I am a budding Bioinformatician. When I am not sitting in front of my computer breaking my head over my programming assignment, I am out exploring different neighborhoods in DC or Boston and hitting up museums to be inspired to think of new ways to solve problems.

### Fun facts about me

It's always a little hard to get to know someone through their GitHub pageâ€”like I don't know anything about you. So let's break that ice and here are a couple of things you should know about me. If there is anything that you can relate with, connect with me! _**(scroll down for contact info)**_

1. I liste to Indie music regardless of how I am feeling 
2. I am chronically obsessed with Jupyter notebook and how convenient it is to program and run code on it
3. I am 5ft 11inches tall i.e. 180cm for my metric system buddies. 
4. I am chronically obsessed with the microbiome research field. 
(if you are working on projects involved in this area, please let me know, I would love to hear/be involved!)
