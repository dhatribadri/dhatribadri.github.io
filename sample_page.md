## Characterizing vermicompost microbiome based on shotgun and amplicon sequecing

**Project description:** This project aimed to compare inferences from metagenomic and metataxonomic 
data to characterize the diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities associated with vermicomposting.
Vermicomposting takes advantage of the synergistic effects of worms and microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) 
to decompose organic waste. Furthermore, worms can enrich the microbial communities of the resulting compost,
enhancing subsequent production as a richer form of organic fertilizer, thus offering a sustainable alternative 
to chemicals while converting waste products into fertilizer. 


### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

Microbial profiles were obtained by shotgun sequencing  of genomes and through amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA for bacteria and ITS for fungi.

  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
